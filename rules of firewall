Source IP address
Who is sending the traffic

Destination IP address
Who is receiving the traffic

Port number
Which service (e.g., 80 = HTTP, 443 = HTTPS)

Protocol
TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.

Direction

Inbound (ingress)

Outbound (egress)

Action

Reject (block + notify)

Logging (optional)
Record the traffic for monitoring

Basic Rules of Firewall Configuration (Very Important)
1. Default Deny Rule

Block everything by default, then allow only what is needed.

This is the golden rule of firewall security 🔐.

2. Rule Order Matters

Firewall checks rules top to bottom

The first matching rule is applied

Bad ordering = security holes

👉 Specific rules should come before general rules.

3. Least Privilege Principle

Allow minimum access required:

Only required IPs

Only required ports

Only required protocols

4. Explicit Allow Rules

Every allowed service must have a clear rule:

Web → port 80/443

SSH → port 22 (restricted IPs only)

Never leave services “open to all” unless necessary.

5. Inbound and Outbound Control

Inbound rules protect your network from outsiders

Outbound rules prevent data leaks and malware callbacks

Many people forget outbound rules — big mistake.

6. Avoid “Any–Any–Allow”

Rules like:

Source: ANY | Destination: ANY | Port: ANY | Action: ALLOW

❌ Very dangerous
✅ Use only temporarily for testing, then remove

7. Use Stateful Rules When Possible

Allow return traffic automatically for legitimate sessions

Prevents spoofed responses

8. Log and Monitor Rules

Log denied traffic

Review logs regularly

Helps detect attacks and misconfigurations

9. Regular Rule Review & Cleanup

Remove unused rules

Disable temporary rules

Update rules when services change

Old rules = hidden risks 🧨

10. Separate Public and Private Services

Public-facing servers → DMZ

Internal systems → restricted access

Never expose internal systems directly.
